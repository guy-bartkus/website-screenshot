# Setup

After cloning, run `npm install` in root of project.
Enter each link on a new ine in `links.txt`.
`npm run start` or `node .` to start program.

## Details

This project is not completely finished, but does work. Made this so I could quickly archive some sciencemadness wiki pages.

## Todo

* Allow to wait for specific element per link
* Allow custom file name for each link instead of using sanitized page title
