# Setup

After cloning, run `npm install` in root of project.  
Enter each link on a new ine in `links.txt`.  
`npm run start` or `node .` to start program.  

## Details

This project is not completely finished, but does work. Made this so I could quickly archive some sciencemadness wiki pages.

## Todo

- [ ] Allow to wait for specific element per link
- [ ] Allow custom file name for each link instead of using sanitized page title
- [x] Create screenshots folder if it does not exists instead of erroring
